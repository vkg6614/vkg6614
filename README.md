### I am learning MERN Stack and Full Stack Web Develper, Bengaluru which makes me busy and professional so that I can make my dream true. I worked on a couple of projects and some couple of data and structure algorithm during my 7 month course. These things make me more professional.

I know about HTML,CSS,Javascript, Reactjs, Redux, Nodejs, NPM packages, Typescript, Postman, mongodb,mongoose etc.

Now my vision is to just become a good and smart web develper.
